Flaggy is an active flag-classification project and a machine learning model whose goal is to detect/classify any country in the world based on a photograph of its flag. Note that this problem is vastly more advanced than a simple flag detection. A photograph can contain a flag in any shape, size, angle, skew, or lightning conditions. The project is in active development.
