Flaggy is an active flag-classification project and a machine learning model whose goal is to detect/classify any country in the world based on a photograph of its flag.

The problem being solved is vastly more advanced than a (flat) flag detection as a photograph can contain the flag in any shape, size, angle, or lightning conditions. The project is in active development.
