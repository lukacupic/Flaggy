Flaggy is an active flag-detection project. By utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning methods, its goal is to detect and match any country in the world (195) from a photograph of the country's flag. Note that this problem is vastly more advanced than a simple flag detection. A photograph can contain a flag in any shape, size, angle, skew, or lightning conditions. The project is in active development.
